### STEP 2
  
- Fill out your config

### STEP 3 (optional)
- Install backpack items in your framework/inventory
- backpacks will need to be purchased through the ped OR use admin command `giveBag playerID itemName`

# How It Works

- use command newStash and fill in the things you want
- use command editStash to edit the required data to open stashes

# Common Questions

- ###     the items wont get out of the inventory and into my pockets
  - #### `not my scripts problem. This is merely a way to **open** stashes. thats it. once you open the stash my script stops.`
- ###    weapons lose durability when i put them in the stash
  - #### `again, not my script.`
